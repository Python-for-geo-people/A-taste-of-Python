# Introduction to the course environment

## Some basic principles about the course environment

- You will launch a new cloud computer instance every time you're working in a lecture or doing the exercises.

- You will **ALWAYS** download the course materials from the course GitHub repository for the week.

- You will **ALWAYS** save everything you have done (codes, figures, data, etc.) on your private GitHub account because files cannot be saved permanently to the cloud computers.

- There is a fixed 'life-time' allocated (**6 hours**) for each computer instance

  - After finishing your work, you should always 'destroy' your course environment by yourself from the [Pouta Blueprints Dashboard](https://pb.geo.helsinki.fi).
  - **Note**: We have tried to design the cloud computers to have reminders to save your work, or that you session will soon end.
  However, when the life-time of the computer instance is finished the system will automatically 'destroy' your Computer Instance and you **will lose EVERYTHING in it** if you have not updated your files on Github.

## Let's start

We'll start using the course environment by creating and activating your account on the Computing Dashboard, and launching our first Computer Instance.
Then we will download course materials from GitHub to your cloud computer, do some work, and save your work back on GitHub. 

- The first time you use the computing environment, you must [create and activate your account on the Computing Dashboard](activate-pb-account.md). **You only need to do this once**.

Here are the remaining steps that you will follow during each lecture.
You will do steps 1-4 below repeatedly during the course, so it will become familiar to you after a few weeks. 

 1. [Log into the Computing Dashboard and launch a Computer Instance](launch-instance.md)
 
 2. [Connect to Computer Instance from your local computer](connect-to-instance.md)
 
 3. [Use Git and GitHub to download the course materials and save your work](intro-to-github.md)
 
 4. [When finished working, destroy the Computer Instance](destroy-instance.md)
