# Introduction to Git and GitHub

We won't be saving any files on GitHub this week.
Instead, your assignment for the Exercise this week is to create a [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) account and we'll learn how to use the [GitHub.com](https://www.github.com) site next week.

That said, be sure you don't forget to [destroy your computing instance!](destroy-instance.md)
