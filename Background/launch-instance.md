# Launching a new computer instance

Launching a new computer instance is a straightforward procedure that is done from the Computing Dashboard. 
These instructions will help you first launch a new Computer Instance and then open a port to it from your local computer's IP address (steps 5-6).
A port in a computer is a somewhat similar to the idea of having a door in a house: you cannot access the house without having an open door. In this analogy, the default computing instance will have all the doors closed until you open one for yourself.

 4. Wait until the instance is ready. You will first see a spinning gear under the **State**, the instance is ready when the gear turns into a checkmark. Now go to instance details by clicking on it's name (here the name is `pb-donna-the-blue`, but it changes every time).

## The next step...
With the new instance created, we can move on to [connecting to it](Background/connect-to-instance.md).
