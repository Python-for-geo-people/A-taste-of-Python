# 1. Launch a new computer instance

Launching a new instance is a straightforward procedure which is done from the Computing Dashboard. 

 1. Go with a browser to [pb-geo.helsinki.fi](pb-geo.helsinki.fi) OR WHATEVER THE ADDRESS WILL BE!
 
 2. Log into Computing Dashboard
 
 3. Launch a new instance
 
 4. Wait until instance is ready (you'll see WHAT?) and 
 go to instance details by pressing it's name 
 (here 'pb-donna-the-blue' but it changes every time)
  
 5. Press 'Query client IP' button
 
 6. Press 'Change client IP' button
 
 7. Go back to Dashboard tab
  
Steps 5 and 6 are done to open a port to the computer instance from your local computer. A port in a computer is a somewhat similar idea than 
having a door in a house: you cannot access the house without having an open door.
 
Next step is to [connect to it](connect-to-instance/).
