# Introduction to the course environment

We'll start using the course environment by creating and activating Computing Dashboard account and launching our first Computer Instance. 

Here are the steps that you need to follow:

 1. [Activate your account to the course environment\*\*](activate-pb-account.md)
 
 2. [Log into the course environment and start the computer](log-in-to-pb-and-access.md)
 
 3. [Connect to the course environment from you local computer](log-in-to-pb-and-access.md#access)
 
\*\* done only once when starting the course

## Some basic principles about the course environment

- You will launch a new cloud computer every time you're on a lecture or start doing the exercises.

- You will **ALWAYS** save everything you have done (codes, figures, data, etc.) on your private Github account because they can't be saved 
permanently to the cloud computer 

- There is a fixed 'life-time' allocated (X hours) for each cloud computer

  - After finishing the lecture or doing the exercises the course environment will be 'Destroyed'
  - After finishing your day, you should always 'Destroy' your course environment by yourself from the Pouta Blueprints Dashboard.
  - Notice: when the life-time of the computer is finished the system will automatically 'Destroy' your course environment and EVERYTHING in it.
