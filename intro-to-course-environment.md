# Introduction to the course environment

## Some basic principles about the course environment

- You will launch a new cloud computer instance every time you're on a lecture or start doing the exercises.

- You will **ALWAYS** download the course materials from GitHub

- You will **ALWAYS** save everything you have done (codes, figures, data, etc.) on your private GitHub account because they can't be saved 
permanently to the cloud computer 

- There is a fixed 'life-time' allocated (6 hours) for each computer instance

  - After finishing the lecture or doing the exercises the course environment will be 'Destroyed'
  - After finishing your day, you should always 'Destroy' your course environment by yourself from the Pouta Blueprints Dashboard.
  - **Notice**: when the life-time of the computer instance is finished the system will automatically 'Destroy' your Computer Instance and EVERYTHING in it.

## Let's start

We'll start using the course environment by creating and activating a Computing Dashboard account and launching our first Computer Instance. Then we will download
course materials from GitHub to our remote computer, do some work, and save our work back to GitHub. 

You will do these steps 2-5 repeatedly during the course so it will become familiar to you after awhile. 

Here are the steps that you follow during each lecture:

 1. [Activate your account to the computing dashboard\*\*](activate-pb-account.md)
 
 2. [Log into the Computing Dashboard and launch a Computer Instance](launch-instance.md)
 
 3. [Connect to Computer Instance from you local computer](connect-to-instance.md)
 
 4. [Use Git and GitHub to download the course materials and save your work](intro-to-github.md)
 
 5. [When finished working, destroy the Computer Instance](destroy-instance.md)

\*\*done only once when starting the course
