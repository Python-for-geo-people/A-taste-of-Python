# Introduction to the course environment

We'll start using the course environment by creating and activating a Computing Dashboard account and launching our first Computer Instance. 
You will do the steps 2-3 repeatedly during the course so it will become familiar to you after awhile. 

Here are the steps that you need to follow:

 1. [Activate your account to the computing dashboard\*\*](activate-pb-account.md)
 
 2. [Log into the Computing Dashboard and launch a Computer Instance](launch-instance.md)
 
 3. [Connect to Computer Instance from you local computer](connect-to-instance.md)

\*\*done only once when starting the course

## Some basic principles about the course environment

- You will launch a new cloud computer every time you're on a lecture or start doing the exercises.

- You will **ALWAYS** save everything you have done (codes, figures, data, etc.) on your private Github account because they can't be saved 
permanently to the cloud computer 

- There is a fixed 'life-time' allocated (X hours) for each cloud computer

  - After finishing the lecture or doing the exercises the course environment will be 'Destroyed'
  - After finishing your day, you should always 'Destroy' your course environment by yourself from the Pouta Blueprints Dashboard.
  - Notice: when the life-time of the computer is finished the system will automatically 'Destroy' your course environment and EVERYTHING in it.
