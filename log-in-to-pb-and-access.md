# Launching and connecting to the Computer Instance

This tutorial will guide you how to start a new computer instance (i.e. the cloud computer) and how to access it from your local computer.
You will do these (2) steps repeatedly during the course so it will become familiar to you after awhile. 
 
## 1. Launch a new computer instance

Launching a new instance is a straightforward procedure which is done from the Computing Dashboard. 

 1. Go with a browser to [pb-geo.helsinki.fi](pb-geo.helsinki.fi) OR WHATEVER THE ADDRESS WILL BE!
 
 2. Log into Computing Dashboard
 
 3. Launch a new instance
 
 4. Wait until instance is ready (you'll see WHAT?) and 
 go to instance details by pressing it's name 
 (here 'pb-donna-the-blue' but it changes every time)
  
 5. Press 'Query client IP' button
 
 6. Press 'Change client IP' button
 
 7. Go back to Dashboard tab
  
Steps 5 and 6 are done to open a port to the computer instance from your local computer. A port in a computer is a somewhat similar idea than 
having a door in a house: you cannot access the house without having an open door.  
 
## 2. Connect to the computer instance

There are basically two things that you need to have for being able to use a remote computer instance: 
 
 - IP address of the (running) computer instance
 - Remote Desktop software (a 'viewer') at your local computer that is used to access the remote computer

There are slightly different ways of accessing the cloud computer instance depending on:
 
 - Operating System (Windows / Mac / Linux)
 - Remote Desktop software (or protocol) that you are using (RDP / VNC)
 
Below are instructions how to access the computer instance on different systems (choose the one that you have). 

### 2.1 Copy and paste the IP address of your computer instance

This step is common for all operating systems.
 
You can find the IP address from the Computing Dashboard under the **'Access'** column. Copy and paste only the numbers. 
We won't be needing the rest of the information mentioned there. *(They are used for taking a specific SSH connection (with command prompt) to the computer).*
