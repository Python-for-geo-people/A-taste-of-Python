Part I of an introduction to Python.

# Course Environment

In this course we will be doing our exercises and learn coding by using a specific course environment 
that is based on principles of [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). 

The course environment is comprised of three components that will be used actively during the course:
 
 - **Computing Dashboard** 
 - **Computer Instance**
 - **GitHub (+ Git)**  

You can use the course environment by any computer at the university and also from your own computer. All you need is a working internet connection,
web browser and a specific [Remote Desktop software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software) that comes with every computer.

The course environment is easy to use and access but there are few things that you need to understand before starting to use it. 

## Computing Dashboard

Computing dashboard is a specific web interface for managing computer instances that is used frequently during the course. 
From the dashboard you will launch a new [computer instance](#instance) (i.e a cloud computer) every time we are doing 
any programming during the lectures or practicals. You will do all the work using such computer instance. 

##<a name='instance'> Computer Instance

Computer instance is basically a Linux Ubuntu computer (tailored for this course)
that you can use in a similar manner as you would use your own computer. 
The difference is that the computer is located in the 'cloud' i.e. it is physically located and run in somewhere else 
(basically on the servers of [CSC Finland](https://www.csc.fi/home)) and you use it remotely from any computer with an internet connection.

## GitHub

Some info about GitHub and a link to a page where guide for creating a GitHub account and logging in + idea about GitHub Classroom  

## Next steps

Now you should have (at least) the basic idea about the different components of our course environment and what we mean by them. You don't need to 
understand everything fully at this point as they will become clearer when we start using the course environment.  

Next, we'll introduce to you how the course environment can be used. Continue by reading the 
**[introduction to the course environment](intro-to-course-environment.md)**.
