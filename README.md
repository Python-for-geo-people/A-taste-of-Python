# Lesson 1: A taste of Python

[//]: # (**NOTE TO OURSELF:** This is now a tutorial for using the course environment and not any Python related per se.)
[//]: # (These docs should maybe be located under a different repo.)
[//]: # (Anyway, the students need to know how to use the course environment the tutorial should be included already in the first weeks contents in [Course information](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Course-information))

The goal of the first half of the course is to introduce you to the basic concepts of computer programming in the Python programming language.
We will start working toward that goal already this week with our first taste of programming in Python.
In order to start learning Python, however, we need to be introduced to the course computing environment, which is based on the principles of [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). 
This first tutorial will introduce you to the basic structure of our course environment, guide you through how it is used, and conclude with a hands-on introduction to some key concepts and elements of programming in Python.
The main components of this first lesson are below.
