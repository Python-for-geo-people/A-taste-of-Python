# Course environment

In this course we will be doing our exercises and learn coding by using a specific cloud computing environment called 'Pouta Blueprints'. 
You can access this course environment by any computer at the university and also from your own computer using a 
[Remote Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software) connection. 

The course environment is basically a Linux Ubuntu computer that you can use in a similar manner as you would use your own computer. 
The difference is that the computer is located in the 'cloud' i.e. it is physically located and run in somewhere else 
(basically on the servers of [CSC Finland](https://www.csc.fi/home)) and you use it remotely from any computer with an internet connection.

The course environment is easy to use and access but there are few things that needs to be done before you can start using the environment. 

Here are the steps that you need to follow:

 1. [Activate your account to the course environment\*\*](activate-pb-account.md)
 
 2. [Log into the course environment and start the computer](log-in-to-pb-and-access.md)
 
 3. [Connect to the course environment from you local computer](log-in-to-pb-and-access.md#access)
 
\*\* done only once when starting the course

## Some basic principles about the course environment

- You will launch a new cloud computer every time you're on a lecture or start doing the exercises.

- You will **ALWAYS** save everything you have done (codes, figures, data, etc.) on your private Github account because they can't be saved 
permanently to the cloud computer 

- There is a fixed 'life-time' allocated (X hours) for each cloud computer

  - After finishing the lecture or doing the exercises the course environment will be 'Destroyed'
  - After finishing your day, you should always 'Destroy' your course environment by yourself from the Pouta Blueprints Dashboard.
  - Notice: when the life-time of the computer is finished the system will automatically 'Destroy' your course environment and EVERYTHING in it.
