Part I of an introduction to Python.

# Course Environment

In this course we will be doing our exercises and learn programming by using a specific course environment 
that is based on principles of [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). 

The course environment is comprised of three components that will be used actively during the course:
 
 - **Computing Dashboard** 
 - **Computer Instance**
 - **Git + GitHub**  

You can use the course environment by any computer at the university and also from your own computer. All you need is a working internet connection,
web browser and a specific [Remote Desktop software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software) that comes with every computer.

The course environment is easy to use and access but there are few things that you need to understand before starting to use it. 

## Computing Dashboard

Computing dashboard is a specific web interface for managing computer instances. We will is use it frequently during the course. 
From the dashboard you will launch a new computer instance instance (i.e a cloud computer) every time we are doing 
any programming during the lectures or practicals. You will do all the work using such computer instance. 

## Computer Instance

Computer instance is basically a **temporary** Linux Ubuntu computer (tailored for this course)
that you can use in a similar manner as you would use your own computer. 
The difference is that the computer is located in the 'cloud' i.e. it is physically located and run in somewhere else 
(basically on the servers of [CSC Finland](https://www.csc.fi/home)) and you use it remotely from any computer with an internet connection. 

## Git + GitHub

One of the core components of this course (besides learning programming) is to learn how to use [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
by using Git and sharing the codes (privately) in GitHub.
 
[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_\(software\)) is a version control software (develop by a famous Finn called Linus Torvalds) that is used 
to track changes in your codes (or whole code repository a.k.a git) without overwriting any part of the earlier changes. 
It is widely used by the professionals to keep track of what theyâ€™ve done and to collaborate with other people.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a web based Git repository hosting service and also a social network. It is the largest online storage space of 
collaborative works that exists in the world. It is a place where you can share your code openly to the entire world or alternatively only to your 
collaborators that are working on a same project. GitHub provides a nice web-interface that is easy to use. 
It is a nice way for exploring the codes and documentations or e.g. teaching materials such as these in our course. 

Both Git and GitHub provide much more features than the ones mentioned here but for now we are happy to understand the basic idea of what they are. 

## Workflow

The figure below illustrates the basic workflow that we will be doing throughout this course. We will be using actively all of the aforementioned components, 
i.e. we will:
 
 1. connect to Computing Dashboard, 
 2. launch a Computer Instance from there,
 3. connect to our temporary remote computer instance,
 4. download the course materials from GitHub,
 5. save our work permanently to GitHub after every lecture or practicals

## Next steps

Now you should have (at least) the basic idea about the different components of our course environment and what we mean by them. You don't need to 
understand everything fully at this point as they will become clearer when we start using the course environment.  

Next, we'll introduce to you how the course environment can be used. Continue by reading the 
**[introduction to the course environment](intro-to-course-environment.md)**.
