# Intro-to-Python-I
Part I of an introduction to Python.

In this course we will be doing our exercises and learn programming by using a specific course environment 
that is based on principles of [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). 
This first tutorial will introduce you to the basic concepts of our course environment and guide you through how it is used.  

You can use the course environment from any computer at the university and also from your own computer. All you need is a working internet connection,
web browser and a specific [Remote Desktop software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software) that comes with every computer.
