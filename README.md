Part I of an introduction to Python.

# Course environment

In this course we will be doing our exercises and learn coding by using a specific cloud computing environment called 'Pouta Blueprints'. 
You can access this course environment by any computer at the university and also from your own computer using a 
[Remote Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software) connection. 

The course environment is basically a Linux Ubuntu computer that you can use in a similar manner as you would use your own computer. 
The difference is that the computer is located in the 'cloud' i.e. it is physically located and run in somewhere else 
(basically on the servers of [CSC Finland](https://www.csc.fi/home)) and you use it remotely from any computer with an internet connection.

The course environment is easy to use and access but there are few things that needs to be done before you can start using the environment. 

Here are the steps that you need to follow:

 1. [Activate your account to the course environment for the very first time (done only once)](activate-pb-account.md)
 
 2. [Log into the course environment and start the computer](log-in-to-pb-and-access.md)
 
 3. [Connect to the course environment from you local computer](log-in-to-pb-and-access.md#access)
