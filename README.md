# Intro-to-Python-I
Part I of an introduction to Python.

 --- _**NOTE TO OURSELF:** This is now a tutorial for using the course environment and not any Python related per se. 
These docs should maybe be located under a different repo. Anyway, the students need to know how to use the course environment the tutorial should be included already
in the first weeks contents in [Course information](https://github.com/Python-for-geo-people/Course-information)_ ---   

In this course we will be doing our exercises and learn programming by using a specific course environment 
that is based on principles of [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing). 
This first tutorial will introduce you to the basic concepts of our course environment and guide you through how it is used.  

You can use the course environment from any computer at the university and also from your own computer. All you need is a working internet connection,
web browser and a specific [Remote Desktop software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software) that comes with every computer.
